Design and Develop a Visual Basic application that could potentially be used to address one of 
the eight Millennium Goals. 
The application must, at the very least, demonstrate polymorphism.
For each additional unique (i.e. you cannot create 10 abstract methods to get 10 x 10 marks) programming 
concept you correctly apply and successfully demonstrate, you will be awarded additional marks, depending 
on its category. This practical assignment will be updated to reflect this category list at a later stage.
